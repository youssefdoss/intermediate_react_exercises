# Intermediate React Exercises

I cloned this repo for my practice purposes. The readme below and the questions within this repo are not my own. This repository contains the exercises for Rithm School's free [Intermediate React](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-react) course.  React is a more advanced topic, so if you are new to JavaScript, we would suggest starting with our free JavaScript courses which are also available on [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses).
